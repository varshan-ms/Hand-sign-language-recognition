# Hand Sign Language Recognition

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system for recognizing hand sign language gestures using advanced deep learning techniques. This system aims to accurately interpret complex hand movements to facilitate better communication for individuals relying on sign language.

## Features

- **Accurate Recognition:** Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract intricate patterns and temporal dependencies in hand gestures.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface built using Tkinter for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of processing hand gestures in real-time for immediate recognition.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Mediapipe, CVZone
- **Interface:** Tkinter
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varshan-ms/Hand-sign-language-recognition.git
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or manually install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install keras
   pip install mediapipe
   pip install cvzone
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launching the Application:** Once the application is running, a window will appear where you can interact with the system.
2. **Making Gestures:** Perform hand gestures in front of your camera. The system will process and recognize the gestures in real-time.
3. **Interpreting Results:** The recognized gesture will be displayed on the interface, providing immediate feedback.
